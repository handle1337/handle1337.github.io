We have the following executable

Time to reverse!

Pretty quick the goal becomes apparent. reach this conditional path.

I've never reversed golang executables before, so looking at this IDA output was pretty intimidating at first, but as I went on I began to get more comfortable with it's quirks. If you spend a little bit of time on it, it becomes pretty clear I promise ðŸ˜…

After labeling some variables I moved onto the logic. There's 2 functions that become of interest almost immediately, `main_b`, and `main_a`

Around this point I switched to Ghidra since the pseudocode for golang was much cleaner + free plug-ins, at the end I ended up jumping back and forth between the two since sometimes one would represent things better than the other.

It's pretty apparent that `main_b` is an error handling function.
Looking at it's references I pieced together the requirements to reach `main_a` but honestly it took me an embarrassing amount of time because of this one rabbit hole:

I spent a lot of time overthinking the whole challenge but then I got ahold of myself the more I looked at `main_a` and realized this was so much simpler than I thought!

`main_a` takes the input when the last prompt `checksum: ` is displayed. Then it xor encrypts `checksum` with the key `FlareOn2024`.

Once it is encrypted, the result is base64 encoded and the program checks whether the two base64 strings match.

So now all that's left to do is follow these steps in reverse!
